SPEECH TRANSCRIPTIONS
---------------------
[998.2s - 998.3s]: Okay.
[1449.4s - 1464.1s]: Yeah, that's the case. I need to go back and look at the spreadsheet. I mean, if the competitor does not apply to that particular stage, they shouldn't be on that tab in the spreadsheet. So are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they don't apply?
[1490.2s - 1505.2s]: Yeah, that's when we tiered them, right? Tier one, tier two, tier three. So this, where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors. That's probably why I cut and paste them because those are all tier ones. So we're just focusing on tier one right now. So if they don't apply to that stage, don't worry about it.
[1506.3s - 1506.8s]: Makes sense.
[1511.1s - 1512.5s]: Right.
[1521.1s - 1525.4s]: Yeah, for now, but then we'll move to tier two and tier three. Then we'll look at those.
[1533.4s - 1537.8s]: Yeah, we should. I think you asked me that before, right?
[1550.9s - 1553.6s]: Yeah. For sure. For sure. Yeah.
[1591.2s - 1591.5s]: Fair.
[1622.9s - 1626.0s]: Well, they all do for tier one except Jenkins and CloudBees.
[1639.6s - 1645.7s]: As a matter of fact, that I go back and add Atlassian because based on conversation, I think we have to do it. I don't think we can leave them all.
[1649.4s - 1661.4s]: It is, Atlassian is on that sheet. Okay, yeah. I went back and added them because based on discussion, like my, I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner, but we can't do that.
[1694.4s - 1698.2s]: Have you guys seen the new infographic that the design team has come up with?
[1699.9s - 1700.6s]: Oh, you haven't?
[1702.2s - 1705.2s]: Do we have a link to that? Quickly, William, I don't know.
[1719.4s - 1720.3s]: It probably won't be me.
[1738.9s - 1739.7s]: I found it. I found it.
[1743.3s - 1744.5s]: I found it, I found it.
[1746.2s - 1756.8s]: So this is the one, so there's two, this is the one for the single tool comparison, but then for the, but it's gonna look the same, but then here's the one for, I just put it in chat for you guys.
[1758.3s - 1761.8s]: And here's the one for the platform players.
[1878.6s - 1886.2s]: That was a big problem. That was one of the big things. It's like, OK, fifteen features, what? What are they? Why do I care?
[1889.0s - 1892.2s]: To say that means nothing to me looking at this page.
[1895.6s - 1904.0s]: No, we're on top of it. Actually, if you read the thread, I brought that up. But she said we can't do it right now, which I understand. But small thing, what do you guys think about the colors?
[1972.4s - 1976.7s]: I think from a competitive mindset and for me, I'm like, let's go hard. Let's put some red on there.
[1978.1s - 1988.9s]: That's just the way I think. Right. So, but I bought it up and that for now, we're going to stick with the green. They recommend it. We stick with the green and see how it goes. But I don't know. I was feeling the red and yellow too.
