SPEECH TRANSCRIPTIONS
---------------------
[242.5s - 248.1s]: I had two questions about that one one is over what time frame are we looking at.
[350.4s - 364.0s]: Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say like vulnerability management, because there were tiny little MVCs all the way along. But if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this.
[365.5s - 372.5s]: It makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual little thing. And then the other point was
[374.0s - 379.3s]: we just had fourteen. Oh, can we just, can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here?
[403.0s - 405.1s]: And are we trying to hit three per stage?
[760.4s - 768.7s]: Harsh responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about having them sort of stack ranked.
[821.0s - 825.9s]: Somebody's one or somebody's three may be more important than somebody else's one.
[1008.4s - 1018.1s]: We need to have a security one in there. We could have either vulnerability management or I was what I've been struggling with a little bit is I'd like to kind of group
[1019.6s - 1024.1s]: the some of this, the proprietary scanning
[1028.5s - 1034.2s]: Without making it sound like they're scanning improvements, because that sounds like they weren't good before. Yeah.
[1051.1s - 1051.8s]: That's kind of old.
[1054.0s - 1058.3s]: I mean, we did the fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago.
[1073.3s - 1092.6s]: It was like last spring or summer. And then we did another set of press around the integration of it because the PR team liked all the, I mean, we got a lot of attention on the acquisition. So they had me do a follow-up on the integration. I just feel like it's kind of worn out now, but.
[1102.4s - 1111.5s]: And review is what we also have in terms of proprietary stuff. We've also got we replaced one of our scanners with some grip.
[1112.6s - 1117.6s]: And we did we have our own proprietary DAST scanner now that's in.
[1118.9s - 1129.7s]: It's in beta called Browzerker.  So it's our answer to scanning single page applications which represent a unique challenge, I think.
[1132.3s - 1136.0s]: I mean, if I could have to, it would be vulnerability management and berserker, probably.
[1157.4s - 1159.7s]: Probably vulnerability management. Okay.
[1538.9s - 1550.4s]: Or someone asked me, I'm just looking at it. Because the way without it, you're basically putting all the things that we're better at.
[2098.9s - 2103.2s]: What's the difference between that slide and the next one that doesn't have anything under security.
[2114.5s - 2117.4s]: So this was like... What I'd do is just your iteration of it.
[2197.6s - 2201.8s]: No, but you can say more speed, less risk. I like that one the best. I don't like the last one.
[2245.7s - 2249.3s]: And it's deliverables. Secure the software factory and its deliverables.
[2256.6s - 2265.9s]: Yeah, so you could say secure and control your software factory and its deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts.
[2283.9s - 2287.0s]: product sounds like car manufacturer.
[2299.1s - 2303.8s]: Yeah, I think I do too. But, but I appreciate the thought, Brian.
[2341.0s - 2346.9s]: I like your move fast with confidence better than increase speed and stay on track.
[2441.5s - 2441.8s]: Bam.
[2446.3s - 2447.1s]: No trade-offs.
[2470.1s - 2471.8s]: We have some leeway with messaging, right?
[2474.0s - 2477.0s]: How about just more speed, less risk with confidence?
