SPEECH TRANSCRIPTIONS
---------------------
[149.5s - 155.3s]: Yeah, we're on like a two week cadence. Okay.
[426.2s - 433.9s]: So we have the Jira stuff is pretty good. There's a couple of things in integrations with VS code that could be notable by
[437.3s - 462.9s]: Can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it? And if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick in. I was going Cindy's direction here, which was thinking, you know, a lot of, and then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall. So we would have like one thing to call them.
[465.1s - 468.5s]: There's several key iterations aligned with Git Ali cluster.
[470.0s - 490.8s]: Several that roll up to a research-based user experience. And I was thinking like, I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket, except that actually that's super typical, right? Like Windows-Eleven or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things. And then they mentioned a longer list of stuff that aligns to that.
[493.1s - 522.6s]: You know, forgave myself for doing something. And at first I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there. But actually when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level that also like I went in thinking this is just a two. I guess part of it is like, I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken. And that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about, but actually some of that stuff's really cool. So I gave it a three.  excitement level, I wasn't sure exactly where to place things.
[523.7s - 535.6s]: But I figured I wouldn't like to Cindy's comment have something that's a one here anyway. But I the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to bucket them as something.
[536.7s - 540.4s]: And so that's kind of how I came down on it. Thanks about that.
[544.8s - 545.8s]: Yeah, I like that.
[624.1s - 635.1s]: I didn't add it, but I can I can add that in. I've got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of the things, but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that.
[825.9s - 843.7s]: And I had I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year from from create. And there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning.  that could be on the list. Like I could give you ten things instead of three.
[880.6s - 889.9s]: We did this one is a PR driven to some degree. What about like a new Ben Christie's product keynote at commit. Are we telling this with that.
[987.0s - 997.5s]: I would say if UX does end up being a flag that we fly, that's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage that would be considered UX improvement.
[1136.0s - 1142.6s]: Okay. Send grip that get picked up as a line item and a couple of the pieces about get that fourteen.
