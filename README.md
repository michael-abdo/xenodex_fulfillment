# Xenodex Fulfillment Process Data

This repository contains all pre-API processing files for the Xenodex fulfillment system. These files handle data downloading, conversion, extraction, and processing before making API calls.

### Configuration

## Data Directory

All downloaded and processed data is stored in `/home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/data/`:
- **output.csv**: Main CSV file containing all processed data
- **drive_downloads/**: Google Drive files organized by type
- **youtube_downloads/**: YouTube videos and transcripts
- **simple_downloads/**: Files from simple download operations
- **downloads/**: General download storage

## Usage

All files have been updated to:
1. Reference the new data directory at `/home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/data/`
2. Import utilities from the original project location
3. Use absolute paths for all file operations

### Running Workflows

```bash
# Run the main workflow
python3 /home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/process_data/workflows/simple_workflow.py

# Download YouTube content
python3 /home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/process_data/workflows/run_youtube_downloads_async.py

# Download Google Drive files
python3 /home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/process_data/workflows/run_drive_downloads_async.py
```

### Testing

A test script is included to verify all paths and imports are correctly configured:

```bash
python3 /home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/test_paths.py
```

## Important Notes

1. All file paths have been updated to use absolute paths pointing to `/home/Mike/Xenodx/fulfillment/data/`
2. Import statements use the original project path: `/home/Mike/projects/xenodx/typing-clients-ingestion-minimal`
3. The configuration file at `config/config.yaml` contains all updated paths
4. Data directories are automatically created when needed

## Migration Complete

All pre-API processing files have been successfully:
- âœ… Moved to the new process_data directory
- âœ… Updated with correct file paths
- âœ… Updated with correct import statements
- âœ… Tested and verified to be working correctly

This represents a complete reorganization of the pre-API data processing pipeline, cleanly separated from the main API processing logic.
